-- 1. INNER JOIN example: Get books and their authors
SELECT Books.Title, Authors.Name
FROM Books
INNER JOIN Authors ON Books.AuthorID = Authors.AuthorID;

-- 2. LEFT JOIN example: Get borrowers and the books they have borrowed
SELECT Borrowers.Name, Books.Title
FROM Borrowers
LEFT JOIN Loans ON Borrowers.BorrowerID = Loans.BorrowerID
LEFT JOIN Books ON Loans.BookID = Books.BookID;

-- 3. UPDATE example: Update the status of books that are currently checked out
UPDATE Books
SET Status = 'Returned'
WHERE Status = 'Checked Out';

-- 4. DELETE example: Remove borrowers who haven't borrowed any books
DELETE FROM Borrowers
WHERE BorrowerID NOT IN (SELECT BorrowerID FROM Loans);

-- 5. Aggregation example: Count the number of books for each author
SELECT Authors.Name, COUNT(Books.BookID) AS NumberOfBooks
FROM Authors
INNER JOIN Books ON Authors.AuthorID = Books.AuthorID
GROUP BY Authors.Name
HAVING COUNT(Books.BookID) > 5;

-- 6. Subquery example: Find borrowers who borrowed more books than the average borrower
SELECT Name
FROM Borrowers
WHERE BorrowerID IN (
    SELECT BorrowerID
    FROM Loans
    GROUP BY BorrowerID
    HAVING COUNT(BookID) > (
        SELECT AVG(BookCount)
        FROM (
            SELECT COUNT(BookID) AS BookCount
            FROM Loans
            GROUP BY BorrowerID
        )
    )
);
